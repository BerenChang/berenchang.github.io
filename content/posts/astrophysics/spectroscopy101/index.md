For a star, its composition, velocity, temperature, age, etc. can all be determined by spectroscopy.

### From the origin

Ancient Greek and Arabian astronomers were the first to notice that the seven-colored rainbow was preceded by sunlight, but the first person to give a correct explanation for this was Isaac Newton (1642-1722). He divided light into seven colors through a prism: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.

However, due to the limitations of optical instruments, Newton obtained the spectral resolution (resolution) is too low, to put it bluntly, the resolution is not enough, the eye is limited to the discovery of the seven colors of light, a lot of information in the refraction of light is lost.


A century later, Fraunhofer (Joseph Fraunhofer1787-1826) through the improvement of optical instruments, grating, telescopes and prisms with the extremely clear spectrum. At this time he noticed that many dark lines appeared on the clear spectrum.

We now call this spectrum the absorption spectrum, and the exact reason for this implicates another physicist.

Gustav Kirchhoff (1824-1887) discovered the secret of spectral darkening in his laboratory. When a beam of light passes through an element (such as hydrogen), the element absorbs a particular wavelength of light, which causes the light to pass through and become “incomplete,” and this is the source of the dark lines. A poor analogy would be to compare the absorption spectrum to the fingerprints of the elements. By looking at the composition and relative position (in this case relative position) of the dark lines in the spectrum, we can see what is around the light source.

Here is a description of the journey of light. A nuclear reaction in the core of the star emits a huge amount of heat, which heats up the surrounding gas, and this heat produces light, which is lost in all wavelengths. The light then travels through the interior of the star to the surface, where it is partially absorbed by elements such as hydrogen and helium along the way (leaving a fingerprint), and finally travels through the vastness of the cosmos to reach our observation point. We analyze this starlight with our instruments to obtain a spectrum, and by looking at the dark lines, the basic material composition of the star can be determined by us.

### Summary

The rainbow is the spectrum. By analyzing a clear spectrum we can tell what matter the star is made of, because the dark lines in the spectrum are the “fingerprints” of its constituent elements.
