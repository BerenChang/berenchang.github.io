<h3> Dark patterns in the spectrum and the movement of stars </h3>

A phenomenon needs to be introduced here first: the Doppler Effect (Doppler). This effect interprets the frequency of waves received by an observer in relation to the relative speeds of the source and the observer. An example of this in life is that a honking train coming toward you seems to have a higher pitch than a train moving away from you. This is because the train is chasing its own sound waves as it comes in, while at the same time emitting them, so the receiver hears them at a higher frequency, and the pitch of the departing train changes in the same way.

The Doppler effect is common to waves, so it can also be applied to light waves. When a star moves away from us, the frequency of the light it emits decreases as a whole, which causes the spectrum to shift in the direction of red light (the opposite direction of blue light) as a whole, the technical term for this is redshift. Here's an example: if Sirius is blue and stationary relative to us, then as Sirius flies away from us, its color will shift from blue to red on the spectrum. If it is going fast enough it will show red. Similarly if the star is flying towards us it produces a blueshift in its spectrum.

Now we can explain why the absorption spectrum in part1 looks at the relative position of the dark lines, because the movement of the object causes an overall translation of the dark lines, and since the universe is expanding and many of the stars are moving away from us, their spectra are redshifted, so looking at the absolute position of the dark lines is never an option. The more redshifted it is, the faster the object is moving away from us. By looking at the amount of redshift we can determine the object's radial velocity, which is the component velocity of the object's velocity in the direction of its line with us. How to measure the complete velocity of a celestial body involves astronomical observations, which I will explain later.

<h3> Summary </h3>

The redshift and blueshift of the spectrum tells us whether the star is moving away from us or toward us, and the amount of spectral shift indicates the magnitude of the velocity.
