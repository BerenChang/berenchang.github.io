- name: Signal Temporal Logic Motion Planning for Quadrotor
  # logo: /images/sections/projects/no-code.png
  role: Team Lead
  timeline: "Mar 2023 - Aug 2023"
  # repo: https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode
  #url: ""
  summary: A framework was constructed for robust quadrotor reach-avoid tasks using signal temporal logic (STL) and geometric control theory. Mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) is used to satisfy STL specifications, producing smooth trajectories with robustness tubes. A Lyapunov-based geometric controller ensures the quadrotor follows the trajectory within the robustness tube. Simulations confirm the framework's effectiveness, and comparisons show it outperforms PID and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC).
